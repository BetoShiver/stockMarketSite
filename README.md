# Stock Market Project
This project was my final vanilla JavaScript project in the Israel Tech Challenge Full Stack Development Bootcamp. 
This project had two separate purposes: 
Firstly, it was a way to work independently on building and designing the web app, and secondly, getting an introductory idea of how libraries,such as react, operate behind the scenes by moving all logic and rendering into separate js files. 

## Building the app
For this project, the main takeaways learned were:
    1. working with rest API's
    2. learning to work with Javascript classes
    3. learning advance ways to work with asynchronous functions and properly handle errors. 
    4. complete (responsive) design of the app's visual appearance.

## Separating logic/rendering 
As can be seen in the code. the goal was to be able to separate, both the html rendering and its accompanying logic for the different components that make up the app, so that each. 

After that, I took it one step further, by separating the initial rendering of the parent div containers into a 'main' js, thus making it so that the Html file would only contain a single empty div (similar to React's 'root' div).
